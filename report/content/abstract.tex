\noindent Threads and processes are the bread and butter of a modern day operating system. To facilitate dealing with threads and processes, most operating systems have introduced useful constructs to allow processes to work in a shared environment.

\noindent In this paper, we present an overview of the available techniques that facilitate inter-thread and inter-process communication and synchronization on multiple operating systems, namely Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X. To show the use of these techniques, we also introduce a few sample programs showcasing the use of inter-process communication.
