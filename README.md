# About

This is the repository of the "Operating Systems and Security" project of Mathijs Saey at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel.
The goal of this project is to discuss the available synchronization and communication techniquest for threads and process that exist in modern day operating systems.

# Running the Code

All of the code found in the `code/` directory has been tested on both Windows 7 and Mac OSX 10.9.1, python 3.3.3 was used.

In order for all of the code to work in windows, the code should be called from the command line (`> python fileName.py`). 
This is required for some of the multiprocessing functionality to work. (see [Multiprocessing](http://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html))
