\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we discussed 10 common instruments to facilitate intra-procedural communication and synchronization. 
Furthermore, we shared a few examples of using these instruments for various ends. 

While reasoning about possible use cases for these tools, it became clear to us that most of these tools have their own specific niche, their very own problem that they tackle. 
It is up to the programmer to find the right tool for the right job, but this is only possible if the operating system offers the right tools. 
Therefore, it is only reasonable that most of these tools find a way to reappear, irregardless of the system the programmer is working on.
